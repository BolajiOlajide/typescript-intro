// yping is a very useful feature to ensure reliability and scalability.
// Type checking helps to ensure our code works as expected. Also, it helps in
// hunting down bugs and errors, and properly documenting our code.

// The syntax to assign a type to any variable is to write the name of the
// variable followed by a : sign, and then the name of the type followed
// by a = sign and the value of the variable.

// // There are three different types in TypeScript: the any type,
// the Built-in types, and the User-defined types. Letâ€™s have a look at each of them.

let myVariable: any = 'This is a string'

// Built-in types
// These are the types which are built in TypeScript.
// They include number, string, boolean, void, null and undefined.

let num: number = 5;
let name: string = 'Alex';
let isPresent: boolean = true;
